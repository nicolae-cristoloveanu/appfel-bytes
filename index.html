                            <p class="mb-0">The most important rule for a stable system is to **NEVER use Automatic Updates.** The standard macOS updater doesn't know about the special OCLP configuration. To prevent issues, we always use a simple, safe manual update process. Please ensure all toggles are OFF in <strong>System Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic updates</strong>.</p>

                            <h3>Create a Time Machine Backup</h3>
                            <p>As a professional best practice, I advise all Mac users to maintain a regular backup,
                                regardless of their machine's make, model, or configuration. Before any system update,
                                it is essential to create a full backup using Time Machine. This is your ultimate "undo
                                button" and safety net, allowing you to restore your Mac to its exact previous state if
                                anything goes wrong.</p>
                            <h4 class="mt-4">What You'll Need:</h4>
                            <p>You will need an external hard drive. Any standard USB external drive from brands like
                                Seagate, Western Digital, or LaCie will work perfectly. For best results, choose a drive
                                that has **at least the same amount of storage as your iMac's internal drive, or
                                larger.** For example, if your iMac has a 1TB SSD, use a 1TB or 2TB external drive.</p>
                            <h4 class="mt-4">How to Set It Up:</h4>
                            <ol class="fs-6">
                                <li><strong>Connect the Drive:</strong> Plug your new external hard drive into one of
                                    your iMac's USB ports.</li>
                                <li><strong>Format the Drive (if needed):</strong> A pop-up may appear asking if you
                                    want to use the drive for Time Machine. If so, click "Use as Backup Disk." If not,
                                    open the "Disk Utility" application, select your external drive, click "Erase," and
                                    format it as "APFS" or "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)."</li>
                                <li><strong>Start the First Backup:</strong> Once formatted, go to <strong>System
                                        Settings > General > Time Machine</strong>. Click "Add Backup Disk," select your
                                    external drive, and the backup will begin. The first backup can take a few hours, so
                                    let it run.</li>
                                <li><strong>Before an Update:</strong> Always ensure your backup is current. Click the
                                    Time Machine icon in the menu bar (a clock with a circular arrow) and select "Back
                                    Up Now."</li>

                        <p class="text-center mb-4">The OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP) is an intelligent application
                            that often guides you through the update process. The key is to follow its prompts. Here is
                            the typical workflow:</p>

                        <div class="guide-card">
                            <div class="step-number">Step 1</div>
                            <h3>Check for OCLP Prompts & Prepare</h3>
                            <p>Before you do anything, open the <strong>OpenCore-Patcher</strong> app from your
                                Applications folder. OCLP will automatically check for updates and prompt you if its own
                                application or bootloader is out of date. <strong>Always accept these updates
                                    first.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Sometimes, when you check for a macOS update in System
                                Settings, OCLP will detect this and proactively prompt you to download necessary
                                libraries in advance. If you see this prompt, accept it. This makes the final patching
                                step much faster.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="guide-card">
                            <div class="step-number">Step 2</div>
                            <h3>Install the macOS Update</h3>
                            <p>Once OCLP is up-to-date, you can proceed. Go to <strong>System Settings > General > Software Update</strong> and click "Update Now." Your iMac will download the official update directly from Apple's servers and begin the installation, which may involve several restarts. This is normal.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Apply Post-Install Root Patches</h3>
                            <p>This is the final and most important step. Each official update from Apple **wipes the custom drivers** needed for things like graphics and Wi-Fi to work on your iMac. This step reinstalls them.</p>
                            <p>After the macOS update is complete, the OCLP app should <strong>automatically open and prompt you</strong> that "post-install root patches are required." Simply follow the on-screen instructions to apply them. If it doesn't open automatically, just launch it yourself and click <strong>"Post-Install Root Patch."</strong> Reboot when prompted to complete the process.</p>

                                    <p>Yes, absolutely! However, it's crucial <strong>not to upgrade on release
                                            day.</strong> The OCLP community needs time (usually 2-3 months) to ensure
                                        the new OS runs perfectly on older hardware. I personally test these major
                                        upgrades and will give my clients the go-ahead once I've confirmed it's stable

                            <p><strong>Updating Windows:</strong> You can update Windows normally. Simply go to <strong>Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update</strong> and install any available updates as you would on a standard PC.</p>

                                <p class="mb-0" style="font-size: 1rem;">To ensure system stability, it is crucial to manage a specific setting within the Microsoft PowerToys application. Please make sure the <strong>"Awake"</strong> utility is enabled. This prevents the iMac's screen from freezing after the system enters a hibernation state due to inactivity. This setting is pre-configured on my builds, but it's important to be aware of it and ensure it remains active.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4"><strong>Updating macOS:</strong> This is very important. To update the macOS side of your dual-boot system, you must follow the **exact same procedure** detailed in the "macOS Update and Upgrade Procedure" section above. This ensures the OpenCore Legacy Patcher configuration remains correct.</p>
